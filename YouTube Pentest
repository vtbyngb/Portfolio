Network Infrastructure    (Wrap The Lines)

The Reconnaissance Phase - Youtube is Owned By Google, and during my reconnaissance phase I gathered data about how the services are distributed to clients. 
The Reconnaissance phase is different From the Enumeration Phase in that the Reconnaissance Phase works with data that is accessible to the public.


What were my Findings? - Google Appears to be running something called a Reverse Proxy, to Utilize as a load balancer and as an added bonus it does add a certain layer of security. 


How Did I Come To This Conclusion? - I did an NsLookup to find the Ip addresses thatâ€™s affiliated with [ www.youtube.com ] I then attempted a connection with the IP Addresses Directly, only to end up at the google search engineâ€¦ I was perplexed for a moment, then I tried a couple of the other cached addresses to verify my findings. 


What Conclusion Did I Come To? - Google is running Virtualization, well it could be ðŸ˜‚. However the real finding is that the services are in the backend, and that the proxy examines the ip packets for information to figure out where to route the connection. To Simplify! Connection â†’ Host_Name_Payload â†’ Service. I didnâ€™t include the Host Name payload during my IP Connection attempt, thus it rerouted me to the Google Search Engine. So then You Might askâ€¦ Where is the Host_Name Payload located? Itâ€™s in the Http protocol and TLS Establishment, which occurs after the TCP connection, and During the TLS connection. To summarize TCP sets up the connection and itâ€™s host agnostic, meaning it doesnâ€™t care about host names just ipâ€™s and ports. The TLS connection secures the connection, with encryption, and uses certificates. 
Once the connection is established and secured, the HTTP packet is sent through the â€˜encrypted tunnelâ€™ and is decrypted by the recipient (hopefully) then the HOST: header is read and youâ€™re then redirected to the specific service you requested. In This Case Youtube!


Why Would YouTube/Google Use A Reverse Proxy? -  Thereâ€™s many reasons why, but I believe one key reason theyâ€™d utilize a Reverse Proxy is to serve as a load balancerâ€¦ What is a Load Balancer? Itâ€™d be a server that connects you to the server you want that has the least amount of Lag. Thatâ€™s a simplified explanation! The reason Why Youtube / Google would use this is because theyâ€™d want to save bandwidth, and provide as seamless of an experience as possible. What Other reasons would a reverse proxy be good for? Well itâ€™d handle the connections, that way internal devices in the network are less vulnerable.
